# Week 4
## Class Recap 8/29/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today Zane gave me his Slack Code of Conduct form so we finally have everyone's conduct form.  Started off with a recap to creating pick up objects and making them kinematic trigger colliders.  We had time left over so we continued on into beginning our overlay so that we can keep a counter of how many objects we picked up.  Everyone had working pick up objects but some were geting issues with the OnTriggerEnter, we spent the rest of class debugging errors.  Tomorrow we'll be recapping what we went over today and then finishing up the scene manager so that on thursday we can begin 1st project discussion.

## Class Recap 8/30/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class went relatively well today.  Had about 10 students in class.  Recapped what we went over yesterday and finished roll-a-ball up with alotof student interaction.  Some of the students even got theirs finished.  Tomorrow we'll be debugging errors for some of the kids, beginning project discussions and then hopefully if we have time going over creating a death scene and transitioning between the main scene and the death scene.

## Class Recap 8/31/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started with recapping scene management and creating the Ui overlay.  Students were having trouble with creating a UI text element and getting it to work.  Took time to debug how to get the issue fixed.  Next, went into switching scenes upon death, it was a harder concept to understand so some students needed extra help and time debugging errors.  Didn't get to discuss projects, that will be saved for next week.  Assigned week #3 blog on what kind of game you want to create.  Zane has also agreed to be the project manager for the class and he will be presenting on a Game Development Document to the rest of the class.  He will also be directing the groups and keeping them on schedule with their projects.

# Week 5
## Class Recap 9/5/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
We started on project kickoff today.  We began with Zane presenting on the topic of the project and scope.  This is a free-for-all project, feel free to design your own genre but be wary of scope.  It MUST be functional and have some style.  Students got into groups of two and created team names.  Afterwards, Zane presented again on a GDD (Game Design Document), students brain-stormed and began making their own until the end of class.  Tomorrow, we'll be doing a concept review along with showing them how to import prototype assets from the store such as cameras and such.  By Thursday, GDD's should be finished and there will be another quiz.

## Class Recap 9/6/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started off today with showing them how to access the prototype and Characters packages apart of Unity.  We showed them how to set things up the hard way, this is the easy way of doing things.  After, we asked them if they had any questions about concepts they didnt understand but no one really had any questions just yet.  We're expecting that to change as they're making their games.  Tomorrow we'll be accepting their GDD's, handing out quiz #2, and starting off on their projects.

## Class Recap 9/7/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started with our HTA quiz #2.  Some kids got 100% on their quizzes which was really good.  After, we went over the blog assignment grading and that gave the kids more enthusiasm to get their blog posts finished even if it's late.  Once we were done with that, we began to give them time to continue working on their projects.  Some students are really enthusiastic and are buying packs off of the Unity Asset store.  We said they're allowed to if they're okay with spending their own money.  We then handed out blog assignment number 4 which was to explain to us in their own words what GDD's are and how they are beneficial to developing a video game.

# Week 6
## Class recap 9/12/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class was just a project wor day today.  Started with a kickoff talk from Zane who got a progress report from all of the students.  Most groups averaged about 15-20% finished with their projects so far.  Alot of students got some good progrss done today.  Elijah and Kaikapu figured out how to add trails to objects so they can create their multiplayer Tron game.  Josh and Justin created a Skybox as a CubeMap using an HDRi just to name a few.  Will be going over different lighting, along with audio for tomorrow's virtual class.

## Class recap 9/13/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Virtual class went well today.  Still only getting about 11 out of 14 students participating in virtual classes.  That's okay, but some students will need to be recapped later on.  Today we went over Lighting, including the 4 different types of lights, ambient lighting and reflective lighting.  We went over how to change scenes from daytime to night time and then we went over skyboxes.  We also checked out the lighting settings menu, dynamic vs baking lighting and where to download new skyboxes and HDRi's.  Tomorrow, Raymond will be talking to each group in depth to find out where they are and how we can help their needs.

## Class recap 9/14/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
First full week of jamming on projects coming to a close.  Most teams are still in the early stages of putting things together.  Lots of bugs, finally hands on with solving out of the box problems, debugging scripts etc.  Lots and lots of frustration but most of them were able to manage.  Starting to pivot from helping them directly to showing them where and how they can solve problems.  Summer was stuck with trying to sign into Microsoft account for Visual Studio so wasn't able to get a lot of good ground today. Good session with Zane walking around monitoring progress of all teams.


# Week 7
## Class recap 9/19/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Another project jam day today.  A lot of cool stuff happened with the students.  A lot of them made the decision to descale their projects because they realized the deadline was coming up soon.  Some students managed to get a multiplayer game working which is awesome.  And alot of others are working on design and styling.  Overall alot of their games are really looking good.  Tomorrow in the virtual class we'll be going over adding audio clips in 2d and 3d and attaching them to GameObjects.

## Class recap 9/20/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today's class we had about 12 students.  We first did a recap of lighting last week to prepare them for tomorrow's test.  All questions will be off of the repo so they should be okay.  Next we went into audio and how to use it.  We discussed the repo I made which included 3D and 2D audio, the audio mixer, and how to implement 3D audio with a trigger.  Tomorrow will be quiz #3 on lighting.

## Class recap 9/21/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today marks the end of the second week of project jam.  We first started with test #3, some students did well, others not so much and I believe that's because we didn't go over it enough before testing them.  After, they continued working on our projects.  One group have learned Blender quickly to create their own environment which was really cool, another student is getting audio into their project.  Next week will be the final week of working on our projects.
