# Week 4
## Class Recap 8/29/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today Zane gave me his Slack Code of Conduct form so we finally have everyone's conduct form.  Started off with a recap to creating pick up objects and making them kinematic trigger colliders.  We had time left over so we continued on into beginning our overlay so that we can keep a counter of how many objects we picked up.  Everyone had working pick up objects but some were geting issues with the OnTriggerEnter, we spent the rest of class debugging errors.  Tomorrow we'll be recapping what we went over today and then finishing up the scene manager so that on thursday we can begin 1st project discussion.

## Class Recap 8/30/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class went relatively well today.  Had about 10 students in class.  Recapped what we went over yesterday and finished roll-a-ball up with alotof student interaction.  Some of the students even got theirs finished.  Tomorrow we'll be debugging errors for some of the kids, beginning project discussions and then hopefully if we have time going over creating a death scene and transitioning between the main scene and the death scene.

## Class Recap 8/31/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started with recapping scene management and creating the Ui overlay.  Students were having trouble with creating a UI text element and getting it to work.  Took time to debug how to get the issue fixed.  Next, went into switching scenes upon death, it was a harder concept to understand so some students needed extra help and time debugging errors.  Didn't get to discuss projects, that will be saved for next week.  Assigned week #3 blog on what kind of game you want to create.  Zane has also agreed to be the project manager for the class and he will be presenting on a Game Development Document to the rest of the class.  He will also be directing the groups and keeping them on schedule with their projects.

# Week 5
## Class Recap 9/5/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
We started on project kickoff today.  We began with Zane presenting on the topic of the project and scope.  This is a free-for-all project, feel free to design your own genre but be wary of scope.  It MUST be functional and have some style.  Students got into groups of two and created team names.  Afterwards, Zane presented again on a GDD (Game Design Document), students brain-stormed and began making their own until the end of class.  Tomorrow, we'll be doing a concept review along with showing them how to import prototype assets from the store such as cameras and such.  By Thursday, GDD's should be finished and there will be another quiz.
