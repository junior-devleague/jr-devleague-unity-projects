## Class Recap 8/29/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today Zane gave me his Slack Code of Conduct form so we finally have everyone's conduct form.  Started off with a recap to creating pick up objects and making them kinematic trigger colliders.  We had time left over so we continued on into beginning our overlay so that we can keep a counter of how many objects we picked up.  Everyone had working pick up objects but some were geting issues with the OnTriggerEnter, we spent the rest of class debugging errors.  Tomorrow we'll be recapping what we went over today and then finishing up the scene manager so that on thursday we can begin 1st project discussion.

## Class Recap 8/30/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class went relatively well today.  Had about 10 students in class.  Recapped what we went over yesterday and finished roll-a-ball up with alotof student interaction.  Some of the students even got theirs finished.  Tomorrow we'll be debugging errors for some of the kids, beginning project discussions and then hopefully if we have time going over creating a death scene and transitioning between the main scene and the death scene.

## Class Recap 8/31/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started with recapping scene management and creating the Ui overlay.  Students were having trouble with creating a UI text element and getting it to work.  Took time to debug how to get the issue fixed.  Next, went into switching scenes upon death, it was a harder concept to understand so some students needed extra help and time debugging errors.  Didn't get to discuss projects, that will be saved for next week.  Assigned week #3 blog on what kind of game you want to create.  Zane has also agreed to be the project manager for the class and he will be presenting on a Game Development Document to the rest of the class.  He will also be directing the groups and keeping them on schedule with their projects.

# Week 5
## Class Recap 9/5/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
We started on project kickoff today.  We began with Zane presenting on the topic of the project and scope.  This is a free-for-all project, feel free to design your own genre but be wary of scope.  It MUST be functional and have some style.  Students got into groups of two and created team names.  Afterwards, Zane presented again on a GDD (Game Design Document), students brain-stormed and began making their own until the end of class.  Tomorrow, we'll be doing a concept review along with showing them how to import prototype assets from the store such as cameras and such.  By Thursday, GDD's should be finished and there will be another quiz.

## Class Recap 9/6/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started off today with showing them how to access the prototype and Characters packages apart of Unity.  We showed them how to set things up the hard way, this is the easy way of doing things.  After, we asked them if they had any questions about concepts they didnt understand but no one really had any questions just yet.  We're expecting that to change as they're making their games.  Tomorrow we'll be accepting their GDD's, handing out quiz #2, and starting off on their projects.

## Class Recap 9/7/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class started with our HTA quiz #2.  Some kids got 100% on their quizzes which was really good.  After, we went over the blog assignment grading and that gave the kids more enthusiasm to get their blog posts finished even if it's late.  Once we were done with that, we began to give them time to continue working on their projects.  Some students are really enthusiastic and are buying packs off of the Unity Asset store.  We said they're allowed to if they're okay with spending their own money.  We then handed out blog assignment number 4 which was to explain to us in their own words what GDD's are and how they are beneficial to developing a video game.

# Week 6
## Class recap 9/12/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Class was just a project wor day today.  Started with a kickoff talk from Zane who got a progress report from all of the students.  Most groups averaged about 15-20% finished with their projects so far.  Alot of students got some good progrss done today.  Elijah and Kaikapu figured out how to add trails to objects so they can create their multiplayer Tron game.  Josh and Justin created a Skybox as a CubeMap using an HDRi just to name a few.  Will be going over different lighting, along with audio for tomorrow's virtual class.

## Class recap 9/13/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Virtual class went well today.  Still only getting about 11 out of 14 students participating in virtual classes.  That's okay, but some students will need to be recapped later on.  Today we went over Lighting, including the 4 different types of lights, ambient lighting and reflective lighting.  We went over how to change scenes from daytime to night time and then we went over skyboxes.  We also checked out the lighting settings menu, dynamic vs baking lighting and where to download new skyboxes and HDRi's.  Tomorrow, Raymond will be talking to each group in depth to find out where they are and how we can help their needs.

## Class recap 9/14/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
First full week of jamming on projects coming to a close.  Most teams are still in the early stages of putting things together.  Lots of bugs, finally hands on with solving out of the box problems, debugging scripts etc.  Lots and lots of frustration but most of them were able to manage.  Starting to pivot from helping them directly to showing them where and how they can solve problems.  Summer was stuck with trying to sign into Microsoft account for Visual Studio so wasn't able to get a lot of good ground today. Good session with Zane walking around monitoring progress of all teams.


# Week 7
## Class recap 9/19/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Another project jam day today.  A lot of cool stuff happened with the students.  A lot of them made the decision to descale their projects because they realized the deadline was coming up soon.  Some students managed to get a multiplayer game working which is awesome.  And alot of others are working on design and styling.  Overall alot of their games are really looking good.  Tomorrow in the virtual class we'll be going over adding audio clips in 2d and 3d and attaching them to GameObjects.

## Class recap 9/20/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today's class we had about 12 students.  We first did a recap of lighting last week to prepare them for tomorrow's test.  All questions will be off of the repo so they should be okay.  Next we went into audio and how to use it.  We discussed the repo I made which included 3D and 2D audio, the audio mixer, and how to implement 3D audio with a trigger.  Tomorrow will be quiz #3 on lighting.

## Class recap 9/21/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today marks the end of the second week of project jam.  We first started with test #3, some students did well, others not so much and I believe that's because we didn't go over it enough before testing them.  After, they continued working on our projects.  One group have learned Blender quickly to create their own environment which was really cool, another student is getting audio into their project.  Next week will be the final week of working on our projects.

# Week 8
## Class recap 9/26/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today was the beginning of the last week of Project work day.  We reminded them that functionality should be finished and they should be using this last week to finish up polishing their games.  Caden has a really cool project where he has to fight aliens and survive as many rounds as possible.  Others projects are beginning to get really visually pleasing.  Tomorrow we'll be giving them a study guide so they can get ready for their quarterly exam in 2 weeks.

## Class recap 9/27/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today was a good virtual class.  I showed them the study guide that I created for them on a website called quizlet.  The study guide consists of all the important key terms and concepts that we've gone over so far throughout the class from the UI interface, to all of the colliders, triggers, debug.log, the console window, then different types of lighting and audio.  You can use quizlet to study and test yourself so I was showing them how to use the website and we went through most of it together.  Tomorrow is the last class day to work on their projects and then presentations begin on Tuesday.

## Class recap 9/28/17 1:45pm - 3:05pm
Today was the last day of project work day.  Today was used to help students with polishing their projects more.  We checked all of the students and they have their functionality done while we gave them advice on how they can polish up their game better.  Students that felt satisfied with their projects went to other teams and were trying out eachother's games.  This will help them get inspired to make something better next project period.  We gave them a blog on teaching a Thing that we taught them.  Take a topic they understand well enough a write a blog to us explaining to us what topic they chose.  Presentations begin next week Tuesday.

# Week 9
## Class Recap 10/3/17
Today was presentation day for all of the members.  It took all of class, alot of them had some really cool stuff to show.  Some students created Open Adventure games with different Win Objectives, other created Maze and Puzzle games.  Once each team was done presenting we gave the students the opportunity to walk around and play test eachother's games.  Note: Some student's computers didnt have an HDMI so we weren't able to connect them to the big screen and instead the students had to crowd around the computer to see the game.

## Class Recap 10/5/17
Today was the day of their Midterm exam, it was about 8 pages long and consisted of 45 questions with two extra credit. Class took about 45 minutes to finish so fo the last twenty minutes we gave them free time until class was over.  We showed Game CLips of upcoming games on the screen and inspired them all to look forward to new games coming out as well as ideas to put into their own game.

# Week 10
## Class Recap 10/17/2017
Today was the first day back after break, it was a productive class with mainly discussion on what were going to be doing going forward.  We first discussed projects moving forward.  We talked about teams and if theyw anted to stay together for the next project or if they wanted to change.  Most teams wanted to stay together but some people wanted to work on their own or create new teams.  One student, Sasha Martinez is on the mainland and she's going to be gone for a week so her partner, Summer Polk is going to be working with someone else.  They all agreed to start over with their projects so we gave them new project requirements which are stricter than the last one.  We then had them work on their new GDD's until about 20 minutes before class where each team went up and presented their ideas for their new game.

## Class Recap 10/18/2017
Today we discussed creating a Menu Screen for their project which will be a requirement.  We had about 10 students in class today so we will have to go over this again tomorrow for the rest of the students. We got to about step 27 in the guide that I created which you can find here: https://github.com/junior-devleague/unity/tree/master/exercises/MainMenu.  Tomorrow we'll be finishing up the guide and hopefully they'll have enough time to start working on their own Main Menus.

## Class Recap 10/19/2017
Today we recapped over creating a menu screen quickly.  I walked them through all the steps of creating a menu screen from the guide and helped out a few students after.  Next week we'll be moving into creating an fps using the first technique which is raycasting.

# Week 11
## Class Recap 10/24/2017
Today was a project day.  We reminded them they have two and a half weeks left, projects are due on November 10th.  We'll be doing project work days every Tuesday and thre last week will be completely project work so they can get it finished.  Tomorrow we'll begin lessons on Raycasting and what it's used for.

## Class Recap 10/25/2017
Today was the first guide day for Raycasting.  There were only 7 students that showed up to Virtual due to PSAT's.  I explained and walked through the guide with them but we'll have to go through the guide again tomorrow for the rest of class.  That will be the lesson plan for tomorrow.


## Class Recap 10/26/2017
Today we recapped again on Raycasting.  I was able to show them everything in depth in person and answer any questions they had about raycasting.  The students began understanding raycasting and are able to use the code for their personal projects if necessary.  Next week we'll be going more in depth into creating an fps game.

# Week 12
## Class Recap 10/31/2017
Today was a project work session day.  We get percentages of overall completion for the project.  Most students have about 60-80% finnished with a few that are a little behind.  I will be setting up personal sessions with students to help those that are behind get their work completed.

## Class Recap 11/1/2017
Today's virtual session went over the basics of using FPS to create a simulated player with a gun.  This would include bullets, aiming, animation, raycasting, reloading, semi/auto fire.  Players will be able to use what we learned today to create the player for any FPs games.

## Class Recap 11/2/2017
Today's session went over using the lesson we went over yesterday in person.  We also gave them time to work on their projects before handing them their weekyl blog which was "Name a Company you would want to work for and give us information about them and why you would want to work there."

# Week 13
## Class Recap 11/7/2017
Today begins the last week of their second project so it is going to be a project work session all week. Students will be completing all of their projects and presenting on Thursday.

# Week 14
## Class recap 11/14/2017
Today's class was used to present final projects.  We allowed groups of up to 4 to work together.  One group decided to work as 4 and one group went as a group of 3.  The rest of the class went as solo or paired up.  They were required to start a new game from scratch with the requirements that were set by what we learned over the past few months.  They were to begin their GDD's and have them turned into me by next week Thursday.

## Class Recap 11/15/2017
Today's class was kept short and was used to finalize everyone's project ideas groups.  They were told to give us a description of their game, who their team members were, and a reason why their project group wanted to follow said idea.

## Class Recap 11/16/2017
Today's class was used as another project work day.  Most students have begun working on their project, working on the collaboration and starting on their environments.  Most were looking up free assets that they would be able to use on their projects.
