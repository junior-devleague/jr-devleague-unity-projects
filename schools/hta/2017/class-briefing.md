Class went relatively well today.  Had about 10 students in class.  Recapped what we went over yesterday and finished roll-a-ball up with alotof student interaction.  Some of the students even got theirs finished.  Tomorrow we'll be debugging errors for some of the kids, beginning project discussions and then hopefully if we have time going over creating a death scene and transitioning between the main scene and the death scene.
