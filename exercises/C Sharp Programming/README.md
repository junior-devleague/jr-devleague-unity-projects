# Tutorial for C# Programming

### This guide was created to help you understand the basics of C#.  A game is only as good as the programming behind the scenes.  There will be some information on making good use of your Dynamic-Random-Access-Memory or DRAM for short.  Misuse of DRAM and Data can lead to random game crashes and bad optimization.  Optimizing a game can be frontloaded or Backloaded.  I.E. Frontload meaning yuou'd be changing visuals, objects, application of Physics, etc.  Backloading means things that happen in the backend where things aren't necessarily visually seen.  This would mean optimizing things such as Databases/Scripts/Libraries/Optimizing control of the game and how it operates.  There's alot that can be done to make a game cleanly polished inside and out, however before you walk you need to learn to crawl and this guide was made directly for this.  

This guide will continue to be expanded and you can use this guide as reference for future projects/quizzes.
