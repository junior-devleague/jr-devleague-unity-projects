# Augmented Reality & Apple ARKit/Unity 'Church' exercise

This tutorial is going to give you some general knowledge on Augmented Reality, and Apple's new iOS 11 framework known as 'ARKit' which was developed so you can easily create AR applications for iPhone and iPad.  If you haven't heard of Augmented Reality yet, believe me when I say you will.  The industry as a whole is expected to be worth over $150 billion by the early 2020's over three categories: 

1. Content (gaming, film and TV, health care, education, and social) 
2. Hardware and distribution (headsets, input devices like handheld controllers, graphics cards, video capture technologies, and online marketplaces)
3. Software platforms and delivery services (content creation tools, capture, production, and delivery software, video game engines, analytics, file hosting and compression tools)

What this means is that Augmented Reality isn't just for gaming/entertainment; this will be used a moneysaving, technological advancement used by every industry available.  Making this a soon hot-topic, while companies from around the world will be demanding developers with experience in AR.  This will bring a whole new meaning to a "Full-Stack Developer", one who can handle databases and architecture, and the otherside which handles Front-End visual definitions.

## So, what is AR and what does it do?

Augmented Reality works by blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, ARKit, for example, takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways.  *This is different from Virtual Reality* where VR takes the real world around and replaces you in a simulated one, Augmented Reality enhances one's *current* perception of reality.

Currently, Augmented Reality can be seen in mobile games such as Pokemon Go (which received a substantial performace increase in iOS 11), and Live Feed tactics for entertainment purposes such as displaying live data over a sports event.  But with the help of advanced AR technology (object recognition, for example) the information about the surrounding real world of the user can become interactive and digitally manipulable. Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world.

This is why Augmented Reality can soon become a revolutionary Digital Technology:

This is a great example of a key use of AR for an airline company.  No more would an airline mechanic have to receive information from a Laptop which can be cumbersome and time-consuming, this is where smart glasses would help with fixing things: the information that the mechanic needs in order to repair the plane appears literally right in front of his eyes.

An Airline Mechanic would be able to receive key information in 3 ways:

1. If the mechanic needs manuals, documentation, or other information, these tools are readily available and accessible on virtual screens right in his field of vision. This helps the mechanic do his job better and faster, and the information provided can be fully contextual.  In the case of Atheer AiR (a software company that focuses on AR to help potential businesses, information can be accessed and manipulated hands-free, even while wearing gloves. Gestures made in the air in the visual field are what enable the wearer of the smart glasses to navigate through virtual screens of information.

2. The mechanic can use collaboration software to collaborate with an expert in another location. Through his smart glasses, the mechanic can share what he sees with a remote expert.

3. Step by step instructions can be established, followed, and navigated via voice or hand gestures. Directions can be made richer, contextual, and conditional based upon the completion of prior steps.

This is just one example for one industry, other business industries are also getting interested about AR's possibilities for example in knowledge sharing, educating, managing the information flood and organizing distant meetings.

"Complex tasks such as assembly, maintenance, and surgery were simplified by inserting additional information into the field of view. For example, labels were displayed on parts of a system to clarify operating instructions for a mechanic performing maintenance on a system. Assembly lines benefited from the usage of AR. In addition to Boeing, BMW and Volkswagen were known for incorporating this technology into assembly lines for monitoring process improvements.  Big machines are difficult to maintain because of their multiple layers or structures. AR permits people to look through the machine as if with an x-ray, pointing them to the problem right away." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality

The new wave of professionals, the Millennial workforce, demands more efficient knowledge sharing solutions and easier access to rapidly growing knowledge bases. Augmented reality offers a solution to that.

## What kind of Hardware can AR be applied to?
While AR is currently being focused on for corporations/enterprises.  AR will have just as much value for consumer use as well.  Smart Glasses, Helmets, a HUD, Bionic Eye Lenses, and even handheld devices will all have valuable use over AR.  Imagine never waiting for a repair technician again, put on a pair of Smart Glasses and receive visual help from an expert directly.  

You ever see that spy/espionage movie where an assassin uses their HUD/Eyewear to hack a system or a Robot display live data through their feed? That's Augmented Reality.

Now that we understand how Augmented Reality can be such an incredible technology, how does it work?

# But first, Baby Steps

## Augmented Reality in the Gaming/Entertainment industry

In Apple's latest software release, Apple has pushed the boundaries just a little bit further.  They did so with a new application programming framework known as 'ARKit', by blending Digital data with Real time environment, you can directly manipulate applications however you want to.
